# dbt_demo

A project template for building, testing, scheduling, and running an ELT data
pipeline as a SQL workflow using:

- [dbt-core](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-core)
- [Github Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) used as runner, scheduler, and orchestrator.
- [Python virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html).
- [Snowflake](https://docs.snowflake.com/) as a data warehouse option.
- [BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs) as a data warehouse option.
- [sqlfluff](https://sqlfluff.com/) used for linting SQL files
- [sqlfmt](https://sqlfmt.com/) used for formatting SQL files

## Code Style Guide

- Follow Mozilla Data Documentation's (SQL Style Guide)[https://docs.telemetry.mozilla.org/concepts/sql_style#sql-style-guide] 
- See dbt docs on [Best Practices](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices)

## Default Configuration

By default, everything gets created as a view. You can override that at the directory level so everything in that directory will materialize to a different materialization.
